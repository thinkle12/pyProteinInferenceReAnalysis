# Code for generating PrEST figures

To convert pyprotein inference results to work with the proteoform-standard plot generator run `python convert_pyproteininference_to_proteoform_standard.py`

To generate EFDR statistics for pyProteinInference results after converting results above, see the READEME.md in the `proteoform-standard` directory
